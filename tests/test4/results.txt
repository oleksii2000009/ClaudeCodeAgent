Task: Antarctic Penguin Species Classification

I'm working on a wildlife monitoring system for researchers in Antarctica. We have morphological measurements from penguins collected across three islands, and we need to automatically classify penguin species from their physical characteristics.

Dataset: tests/test4/penguins_size.csv

The goal is to classify penguin species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo) from body measurements. This will help field researchers quickly identify species without expert knowledge.

Can you:

1. Explore the dataset and visualize how species differ in their measurements
2. Handle missing values appropriately (the dataset has some NA values)
3. Build classification models - try at least 3 different algorithms
4. Evaluate using proper metrics for multi-class classification (accuracy, F1, confusion matrix)
5. Analyze which body measurements are most useful for distinguishing species
6. Create visualizations showing decision boundaries or feature importance
7. Test if we can also predict the penguin's sex from measurements (bonus task)

Important considerations:

- Use stratified cross-validation to ensure balanced evaluation
- Consider whether island location should be used as a feature or if we want island-independent predictions
- Report per-class metrics since some species may be harder to classify than others
- Track all experiments with MLflow so I can compare approaches
- Save the best model for deployment in our field identification app
- I want clear visualizations that researchers can understand

This is for educational/conservation purposes - the model will help train new field researchers.

Key Findings
Excellent separability: All 5 models achieved >95% CV accuracy - the penguin species are well-distinguished by morphological measurements
Feature importance (from Random Forest):
Culmen length: 39.8%
Flipper length: 29.5%
Culmen depth: 24.6%
Body mass: 6.2%
Island-independent model: Built without island features, so it works across all Antarctic locations
