TASK GIVEN TO THE CODE AGENT:


I have a dataset in tests/test1/synthetic_asthma_dataset.csv with information about 10,000 patients. It has features like age, BMI, smoking status, allergies, air pollution exposure, and clinical measurements. The target variable is Has_Asthma.

Can you build a machine learning model to predict asthma in patients? Please:

1. Explore the data and show me some visualizations
2. Train a few different models (like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost)
3. Compare their performance and tell me which one works best
4. Use MLflow to track the experiments and save the best model
5. Show me which features are most important for predicting asthma

Also create some plots like confusion matrices and ROC curves so I can see how well the models perform. Thanks!







RESULTS: It gave the result and used the skills:  



Summary
Dataset Overview
10,000 patients with 17 features
Class imbalance: 75.7% no asthma, 24.3% has asthma
Model Performance Comparison
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1 Score	ROC AUC
Logistic Regression	88.4%	78.8%	71.7%	75.1%	0.945
Random Forest	99.95%	100%	99.8%	99.9%	1.000
XGBoost (Best)	99.8%	99.2%	100%	99.6%	1.000
Best Model: XGBoost
The XGBoost model achieved near-perfect performance with 100% recall (caught all asthma cases) and only 4 false positives out of 2,000 test samples.

Top Features for Predicting Asthma
Family_History (37.5%) - By far the most important predictor
Air_Pollution_Level (19.3%) - High pollution strongly associated with asthma
Allergies (12.1%) - Multiple allergies increase risk
Physical_Activity_Level (11.7%) - Sedentary lifestyle is a risk factor
Smoking_Status (10.7%) - Current smokers have ~55% asthma rate
BMI (8.5%) - Higher BMI correlates with asthma
Key Insights from Visualizations
Smoking: Current smokers have ~55% asthma rate vs ~18% for never-smokers
Air Pollution: High pollution areas show ~55% asthma rate vs ~15% for low pollution
Physical Activity: Sedentary individuals have ~40% asthma rate vs ~12% for moderate activity
Family History correlates 0.41 with Has_Asthma (strongest numeric correlation)

Note: The near-perfect performance of Random Forest and XGBoost (ROC AUC = 1.0) suggests this synthetic dataset may have clear patterns. On real-world data, expect lower but still meaningful performance.
