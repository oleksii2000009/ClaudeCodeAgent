Task: Parkinson's Disease Telemonitoring Prediction

I'm working on a telemonitoring system for Parkinson's disease patients. We have voice recordings from patients and want to predict their UPDRS scores (disease severity) remotely.

Dataset: tests/test3/Parkinsons-Telemonitoring-ucirvine.csv

The goal is to predict total_updrs (total symptom severity score) from voice biomarkers. This could help patients avoid frequent hospital visits.

Can you:

Analyze the voice biomarkers and their relationship to disease severity
Handle the fact that we have multiple recordings per patient (subject column)
Build models to predict total_updrs - try at least 3 different approaches
Since this is medical, I need to understand model uncertainty and error distributions
Create visualizations showing prediction accuracy and residual patterns
Tell me which voice features are most predictive of Parkinson's severity
Important considerations:

We need to be careful about data leakage (same patient in train and test)
Medical predictions should be interpretable when possible
Track all hyperparameters so experiments are reproducible
I want to be able to compare all model runs and review them later
Save the best model for potential deployment in our telemonitoring app.



RESULTS: 
Parkinson's Disease Telemonitoring Prediction - Complete
I've built a comprehensive ML pipeline to predict UPDRS scores from voice biomarkers. Here's what was accomplished:

Key Findings
Dataset Overview:

5,875 voice recordings from 42 patients
Target: total_updrs (range: 7-55, mean: 29.02)
16 voice biomarker features (jitter, shimmer, HNR, etc.)
Most Predictive Voice Features:

HNR (Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio) - negative correlation
RPDE (Recurrence Period Density Entropy) - positive correlation
PPE (Pitch Period Entropy) - positive correlation
Shimmer APQ11 - positive correlation
DFA (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis) - negative correlation
Model Results (Patient-Aware Split)
Model	Test RMSE	Test MAE	Test R2
ElasticNet	12.23	11.46	-0.32
Gradient Boosting Tuned	12.66	11.64	-0.41
Ridge Regression	12.27	11.48	-0.33
Random Forest	12.49	11.78	-0.38
Important Medical Considerations
Why R2 is negative: The strict patient-aware split (no patient appears in both train/test) reveals the fundamental challenge - UPDRS scores are highly patient-specific. Voice features alone explain within-patient variation but struggle to generalize across patients.

Uncertainty Quantification:

95% Prediction Interval: +/- 20.7 UPDRS points
This is clinically significant - predictions should be used as screening tools, not diagnostic replacements
