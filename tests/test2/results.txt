I have a dataset of famous historical people at tests/test2/database.csv with 
Wikipedia stats and popularity scores. I want to predict historical_popularity_index.

Can you:
- Explore the data and show me interesting patterns
- Try multiple models (at least 3) and log all the results so I can compare runs
- Track the hyperparameters you use for each experiment
- Save all charts and plots as artifacts
- Register the best performing model so we can use it in production later
- Tell me which features matter most for fame

I want to be able to go back and review all experiments later, so make sure 
everything is properly tracked and organized.

What Drives Historical Fame?
birth_year (79.7%) - The most dominant factor. Older figures have had more time to accumulate fame
article_languages (12.0%) - Being covered in many Wikipedia languages indicates global recognition
page_views (4.8%) - Current interest/engagement
longitude/latitude (~1.6%) - Geographic location matters slightly
domain/industry (~1%) - Field of work has minimal direct impact
